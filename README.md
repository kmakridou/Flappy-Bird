Flappy bird development with Unity & C#.
This is a remake of the Flappy Bird, it contains: a main menu, game sounds, obstacles, score and highscore. 
The player needs to pass between the pipes without touching them or the ground. The score counts each time and only the highest is getting stored. The difference between the original game and this game is that this version contains a coins generator - where the player can collect coins and add points to the score and a diamond genarator - where the player collects diamonds that reduses the range of its movement and results in a more stable movement which helps to achieve a highscore, this power up lasts for 5 seconds.
The basic setup of the game is based on this YouTube tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrtniEypydc&list=PLe1zD2BokEtzZ_cIvYTz_7X0xS-e4ss9N&ab_channel=BroskisGames
